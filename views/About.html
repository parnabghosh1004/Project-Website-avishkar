      <h2>About Website</h2>
      
      <div class="fakeimg">By seeing the current pandemic situation, it became hard for teachers to teach and students to study. In order to solve this problem, we have made an attempt to make an online whiteboard which will make the learning process easier and comfortable.
          By using this website, teacher can easily create a classroom and student can join the class after signing in to the website. Here, teacher can easily write anything on the board, he can draw any figures and also he can give permission to the students to access the whiteboard. Whiteboard's image can be saved and it can be send directly to the students via email. 
          We have also given an option of group chat where anyone can write their message an everyone can see it.
